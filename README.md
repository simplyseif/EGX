# EGX-AI API
EGX-AI is a user-friendly RESTful microservices API developed using Java Spring Boot 3. It provides real-time updates on Egyptian stock market news, prices, and comprehensive OHCLV (Open, High, Close, Low, Volume) statistics. Users have the ability to subscribe to email notifications for price changes and stay informed about news updates related to their selected equities. Additionally, the API includes a recommendation system that suggests news articles based on users' reading history.

The project follows a modern event driven microservice architecture, ensuring scalability and flexibility. It incorporates a secure authentication system powered by OAuth2 and OIDC with Keycloak, guaranteeing the confidentiality and integrity of user data. The primary database used is Postgres, while TimescaleDB efficiently handles the storage of time-series stock market data.

To simplify the deployment and management processes, the services are containerized using Docker. This approach allows for easy setup and ensures consistent execution across different environments.
